            Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly
            or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing
            at different e-retailers. version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.
